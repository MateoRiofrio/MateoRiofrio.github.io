## Website Development: Portfolio

## Description

Implemented a website to hold the most recent projects I have worked on. This simple website was built using HTML/CSS, PHP, and Bootstrap. 

## Implementation 
`Bootstrap:` Handles responsiveness of the site, as well as padding and margins around the components of each page. The row and column grid system is used. 

`CSS:` Used to provide color to html elements and set maximum/minimum dimensions to the images on the site. 

`PHP:` Used to hold code seen across multiple pages such as the header, footer, and navigation bar.
